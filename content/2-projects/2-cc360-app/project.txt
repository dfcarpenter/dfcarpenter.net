Text: ## Overview
  The Career and College 360 app is the first part of a  larger platform. The first module we (me and my (link: http://yerrington.net text: co-worker popup: yes)) created, and shown here, is for career guidance. It's designed around a unique presentation and manipulation of their own proprietary data and government data, resulting in a stimulating, challenging and yet fun experience for students to find the careers they want.

## What I did
Their curriculum was first created in Excel and worked well for the small groups they were testing with, but I had to translate and improve that design for their web application.  Over the course of about six sessions I devised a workflow following the original, but adapted to follow good UX practices and web conventions for usability. The first phase went fairly smoothly, and with only several revision meetings we released 1.0 clean and very usable. 

During the second phase of the project the client wanted a portion of the app upgraded with new features and we chose Backbone to do the job. This part of the app essentially became a mini single page app (SPA) inside of the larger application. Our data model wasn't too complicated, due to the  amount of work we put into creating a clean api which did most of the heavy lifting for us. I was involved in every aspect of this development from writing some of the api in Laravel to fleshing out the views and models in Backbone.

We chose (link: http://laravel.com text: Laravel) for the application framework because it followed good conventions, was robust, and it would be easy for any developers we brought on to jump in quickly.  

It's still a work in progress and we have lots of exciting features to add. Stay tuned.
