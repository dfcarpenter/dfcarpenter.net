Text: ## Overview
The Career and College site was created for a new education startup, Career and College 360. 

## What we did
 CC360, after some early success with beta tests and new clients, was in the process of  expanding their program with a diverse set of different clients, ranging from universities to non-profits and families. This wide field of customer types made it difficult to design without copy and other content available. As such, the client and I worked together to get it centered around their key current clientele, families,  while not constraining it so much that content could not be used for the next stage of the site.
 
Initial designs were done in Photoshop and Bohemian Coding's Sketch, resulting after several iterations on a minimal theme and layout.

## The Future
With lots of growth for CC360 I am starting work on an almost totally revamped site using Craft CMS. Stay tuned.
