Text: Spiralscoop is a very early beta/test concept centered around making managing brand promotion easier on instagram. My client and several other interested marketing professionals found managing brands and communities on instagram a tedious task (which granted, instagram is not built for) and wanted an interface for interacting with their users submissions easier as well as getting richer analytics.
