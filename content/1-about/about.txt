Title: About

----

Text: My name is Daniel Carpenter and I am web developer/designer based out of San Jose. I currently work as a full stack developer at Maximum Labs, a small studio based out of Emeryville.

In a previous life I was first a network and systems engineer and after that on my way to a PhD in Political Science. Through my academic research (using python and R) I discovered a passion for programming and found I liked making web applications better than plotting crime statistics and congressional voting. 

## What I Use
- PHP (Laravel, Yii, Wordpress, Kirby, Craft)
- Javascript (Node, Express, Angular, Backbone,  jQuery, D3)
- HTML5/CSS3 (Bootstrap, Foundation)
- Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch
